# Basic Information for Project Development

This part of the documentation will contain basic information one needs to know in order to carry on with the project.

## Purpose 

The purpose of the Unreal Engine application is to do what it does best: displaying 3D models with interactive frame rates.

It consists of two main levels: **Explorer Level** and **Quiz Level**. In the Explorer Level, teachers and students can freely explore a fully loaded 3D model of the human body.

In the Quiz Level, teachers and students—primarily students—can complete quizzes that are created by the teachers.

## Setting Up 

To begin development of this application, you need [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) version 5.4, which can be found in the [Epic Games Launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download).

### Windows

For Windows, you also need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) with the following workload items added:

- Game Development with C++
- .NET SDK (can be installed by enabling .NET desktop development)

Once you have everything set up, you can launch the project by opening the `ThreeDAnatomy.uproject` file with Unreal Engine. 

To add the necessary files to open the project with Visual Studio, run `Tools > Generate Visual Studio Project`. Then, open the project in Visual Studio by opening the generated `ThreeDAnatomy.sln` file.

### Mac OS

----------------

For Mac OS install [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), and launch the project by opening the `ThreeDAnatomy.uproject` with Rider.

### Linux

-----------------
