##Â Anatomy

Learning the anaotmy of human body can be challanging without the access to the right resources. During lectures teachers usually have presentation where they display different parts of the human body. 

Problem is that they can not move the part as they see fit, instead they have to find picture from different angle which is not fast nor optimal.

This applications will ease the teaching approach of the teachers as well as learning approach of the students.

Key benefits of the Unreal Engine application is that the body model loaded is fully interactable which means that students can get more general picture of what is going on inside our body.

On top of that teachers can display various organs, bones, arteries etc. as they see fit from whatever angle they choose.

## Learning 

As mentioned students can practice theri knowledge using this application. By the interactive quiz which is build inside the Unteal Engine. The questions from the teachers which are then displayed on the quizz level are fetched via the API call to the website that is used for creating suc quizzes [here]()

## Our goal 

Our goal is simple, ensure the simplest possible way for teachers and students to gain knowledge about the body of human beeing and therefore contribute to the society.
