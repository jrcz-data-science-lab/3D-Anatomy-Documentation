# Virtual Anatomy Documentation
Documentation created using MkDocs.

## Branches 
- **`main`**: Contains the main content of the documentation.
- **`gh-pages`**: Auto-generated by a bot, contains the published documentation.

## Installation 

Ensure that you have `pip` and `python` installed.

Then, run the following command to install MkDocs:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

Afterward, serve the documentation locally by running:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Make sure to execute this command in the root of the repository.

## Adding Pages 

You should **always** add new `.md` files to the `docs` folder. You can create new folders if necessary. 

## Deploying Your Site

1. Open the `mkdocs.yml` file.
2. Edit the `nav` section.

For example, if you've created documentation in a new folder called `NewDocs` and your `.md` file is named `NewFancyDocs.md`, you should add the following to the `nav` field:

```yml
site_name: 3D-Anatomy-Docs
include_sidebar: false
site_description: 'Documentation for VirtualAnatomy'
##...
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About Project: about-project.md  
  - NewDocs: NewDocs/NewFancyDocs.md
```

3. Once you're done, add your changes, commit, and push. The GitHub action will trigger, and the `gh-pages` branch will be updated with your changes.
